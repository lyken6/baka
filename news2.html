	<h1>Bangladesh Crisis</h1>
	<p>Bangladesh Army Chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman announced that Nobel laureate Prof Muhammad Yunus will be sworn in as head of the interim government on Thursday. Former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, in a statement following her release, called for a “democratic Bangladesh where all religions are respected.” Yunus, in an exclusive Reuters interview, emphasised the need to “make the best use of our new victory” and avoid letting it slip away due to mistakes. Yunus was appointed to lead the interim government on Tuesday, as announced by the President’s Press Secretary. This follows a major reshuffle in the Bangladesh Army after Sheikh Hasina’s escape amid deadly protests over a controversial job quota system.</p>
	<p>Amid the ongoing political crisis in Bangladesh, India has recalled non-essential staff from its High Commission and consulates. Sources said return of non-essential staff and families from Indian High Commission in Dhaka has taken place on a voluntary basis through commercial flight. All diplomats remain in the High Commission. The High Commission remains functional, sources said.</p>
	<p>At least 20 bodies of Awami League members, associates and their kin were recovered from the country on Tuesday, Dhaka Tribune reported. Meanwhile, New Delhi is chalking out plans to host the neighbouring country’s ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.</p>
