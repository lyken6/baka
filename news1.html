	<p>Vinesh Phogat has appealed against her disqualification from the wrestling final at the Paris Olympics 2024 with the Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS).

	<p>Vinesh, who had won the semi-final bout via a 5-0 margin was the first Indian woman wrestler to qualify for the final in the Olympics. India Today has learnt that Vinesh asked that she be given the silver medal. CAS has asked till Thursday, 8 August morning to give its final verdict. If CAS rules in Vineshâ€™s favour IOC will have to award a joint silver to Vinesh.</p>
